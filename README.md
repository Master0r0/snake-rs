# Snake-rs

A snake game written in Rust using Vulkan for rendering.\
This was mostly a learning experience for me, a way to put what I've learnt about Rust into a project aswell as learning
Vulkan through the Vulkano Rust API.\
I'm sure there are lots of issues with it and I will clean things up over time
but for my first attempt at rendering with Vulkan and making a game using Rust, I think I did ok.
